## Guidelines for Adding a Relativity Forms Event Handler Example

- Forms Javascript Event Handler examples should be placed under the JsEventHandlerExamples directory.
- The filename should follow the structure of \<EVENT_NAME\>-\<EVENT_HANDLER_NAME\>.js.
- At the top of your JS event handler, you should include a code comment with a name and description of what the event handler does.
- Update the README.md to add your new addition to the Contents section.
- Your example should:
    - be clear and concise
    - detail a common workflow that may benefit the greater Relativity Forms Developer ecosystem
    - use supported Relativity Forms APIs
    - use meaningful variable and function names
    - include code comments where necessary to provide context or give clarity
    - make sense and generally be bug-free, but does not have to work out of the box (you can have spots where information must be filled in)
