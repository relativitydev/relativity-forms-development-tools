# Relativity Forms Development Tools

The Relativity Forms Development Tools repository's purpose is to house tools to aid development of Relativity Forms PageInteraction event handlers.

## Contents

Currently, this repository holds the EH Fiddle Application in both RAP and Source format.

### EH Fiddle
The EH Fiddle Application is a tool which allows rapid testing of Relativity Forms PageInteraction event hander JavaScript without having to create the .NET PageInteraction event handler or even a Relativity Application to host it, yet.

## Futures
In the future, this repository will include a JavaScript library for unit testing Relativity Forms in your own development environments, and potentially also a project template for automation of your Relativity Forms development with NodeJS.
